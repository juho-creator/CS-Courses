# Big-O and Algorithmic Analysis
- Doesn't necessarily give a direct comparison of the performance
    - it focuses on the kind of growth a runtime incurs as a function's input grows.
- [Demonstration of Runtime Estimation with Exponential Growth](https://github.com/juho-creator/CS-Courses/edit/main/CS106B/BIG_O.cpp)
- O(log N) ≈ O(1)   (refer to [relative growth rates of common Big-O runtimes](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/lpjjt51rdd))


# Performing Big-O and Algorithmic Analysis
1. Identify operations(s) executed the most
2. Count their occurrences.
3. Drop lower-order terms and constant coefficients
