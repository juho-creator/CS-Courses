# Computational complexity analysis
Evaluating how efficiently an algorithm uses time and memory as the input size grows. </br></br>


### Example : Sorting only by comparisons of keys

- O(n lg n) is lower bound for algorithms that sort by comparing keys

- [Insertion Sort](https://github.com/juho-creator/CS-Courses/blob/main/Notes/Algorithm_Notes/InsertionSort.md)
  - Sort with insertion
- [Exchange Sort](https://github.com/juho-creator/CS-Courses/blob/main/Notes/Algorithm_Notes/exchangeSort.md)
  - Compares the first element with every element if any element seems out of order it swaps

- [Selection Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-PGLbMth_g)
  - Swap current item with current minimum 
- [Merge Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqmGXwpLqc)
  - split, sort and merge
  
- [Quick Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoixgm4-P4M)
  - Choose pivot, partition array, recursively sort partitions, combine
    
- [Heap Sort](https://github.com/juho-creator/CS-Courses/blob/main/Notes/Algorithm_Notes/HeapSort.md)
  - Create max heap
  - Remove largest item
  - Place item in sorted partition
