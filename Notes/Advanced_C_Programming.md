### Why use pass by value over pass by references?
- To update the value within the function without affecting the actual value at the main function.
- To set roles in certain functions only.

### Why use pass by const reference over pass by reference? 
- **Prevents modification**
  -  Function cannot modify the original object passed to it.
- **Avoids unnecessary copying**
  - Works with the original object directly without incurring the overhead of copying.
- **Allows passing temporary objects**
  - Permits passing temporary objects (rvalues : integers) to the function.
- **Expresses intent**
  - Explicitly shows that the function does not intend to modify the object being passed.
